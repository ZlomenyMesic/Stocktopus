# Stocktopus 1
The first Stocktopus chess engine (~1000 elo) 

It's my first chess engine, therefore it isn't that good. The search depth changes from 4 to 8 during the game. The engine doesn't know en passant, there is no time control and a very poor opening book. This version will no longer be updated, because a faster and stronger engine is coming.
